# Numerical-Analysis
I am a TA of Numerical Analysis in the semester of 2020-21-2 in SUFE. I write some supplementary reading materials through the semester. This materials include:
- A lecture note I wrote last year when I was a student of the lecture
- Six supplementary materials of all the chapters which will be taught in the class

The contents include:
- An intro. of numerical analysis
- Interpolation
- Function approximation
- Numerical integration and differentiation
- Solving linear equations
- Solving non-linear equation and equations

I write some codes to implement the algorithms in the book (in R and Python) and add some algorithms and comments which are not in the book.

If you find mistakes and bugs, feel free to drop me an issue.
